Now mjs will be standardiesd.
but we will be learning cjs as in idustries they are using cjs.


to use mjs make package.json and 
{
  "type": "module"
}


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------
module.export is also empty object and many use it as 
module.exports.x = x;
module.exports.sum = sum;
module.exports.sub = sub;

and while importing use it as 
//const mod = require("./sum.js");
